Welcome to my website!
My name is Jonathan Ji, and I am a third-year undergrad studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at UC Berkeley. 

I am currently an undergraduate researcher at SLICE Lab at Berkeley, where I am being advised by Flavien Solt and Prof Christopher Fletcher, working on a solo project to find and exploit bugs in formal verification tools such as Jasper. 
Before I was an undergraduate researcher at the Space Science Laboratory, writing embedded software for the [Background Transisent Observer on Nasa's COSI](https://cosi.ssl.berkeley.edu/bto/) satellite. Outside of research, I was the Electrical Lead for [CALSOL](https://calsol.berkeley.edu/), UC Berkeley's Solar Vehicle Racing Team, and have extensive experience with designing PCBs and surviving integration hell. 
This semester, I'm exploring digital design (ASICs), analog IC design, post-silicon verification, and teaching the Intro to Machine Structure (CS 61C) course!

Outside of classes, I enjoy playing soccer, playing the bass guitar, and learning how to DJ.
